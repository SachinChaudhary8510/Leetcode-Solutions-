# 🧮 LeetCode Problem 367: Valid Perfect Square

## 📘 Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `num`.

**Objective:**  
Return `true` if `num` is a **perfect square**, and `false` otherwise.

- A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of another integer.
- **Restrictions:**  
  ❌ No use of built-in functions like `sqrt()` allowed.

---

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`num = 16`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
4 × 4 = 16. 4 is an integer.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`num = 14`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
3.742 × 3.742 ≈ 14. 3.742 is **not** an integer.

---

## 🔒 Constraints
- `1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1` (i.e., up to 2.14 billion).

---

## 💻 Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        return (float)((int) Math.sqrt(num)) == Math.sqrt(num);
    }
}
```

---

## 🐍 Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
        x = int(num ** 0.5)
        return x * x == num
```

---

## 💠 C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long long left = 1, right = num;
        while (left <= right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid * mid == num) return true;
            else if (mid * mid < num) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) — in current solution (just one floating-point operation).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

## 🌟 Critical Analysis

### ✅ Positive Observations:
- Short, fast, and concise.  
- Works correctly for *most practical cases* within `int` limits.

---

### ⚠️ Skeptical Critique:
- **Violation of Explicit Constraints:**  
  Problem **strictly prohibits** using library square root functions (`Math.sqrt()` is disallowed). This solution is **non-compliant**.
  
- **Floating-Point Precision Risks:**  
  - IEEE 754 double-precision math (`Math.sqrt()`) is *good* but not *perfect* for large integers (near 2^31-1).
  - Rounding errors **may** cause incorrect behavior when checking `(float)((int)sqrt(num)) == sqrt(num)`.
  - You are **relying on floating-point comparison** which is notoriously risky in critical systems (e.g., finance, simulations).

- **Professional Risk:**  
  Any senior reviewer would flag this as a **rejection** in a code review for both non-compliance and risk of edge case failures.

- **Technical Debt Introduced:**  
  Hidden reliance on underlying JVM floating-point stability.

---

## 🚩 What a Production-Grade Solution Should Do:
**Correct, constraint-compliant** methods include:
- **Binary search** over integers to find an exact square root (pure integer math).
- **Newton's method** (using only integer divisions and multiplications).

**Example Binary Search Algorithm:**
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long left = 1, right = num;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long square = mid * mid;
            if (square == num) return true;
            else if (square < num) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
✅ This approach uses **only integer math**.  
✅ No floating-point precision risk.  
✅ Fully compliant with the "no built-in sqrt" rule.

---

## 📢 Final Verdict
- **Is the Given Solution Correct?** ❓ — Mostly correct for casual use, but fundamentally **non-compliant** and **risky**.
- **Would It Be Accepted in a Professional Codebase?** ❌ No.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  Rewrite using integer-only binary search to guarantee correctness across all valid inputs and comply with explicit problem constraints.

---

> ⚠️ **Bottom Line:** Never use `Math.sqrt()` or floating-point operations when the problem strictly forbids it. Compliance to specification is non-negotiable in production-grade systems.
