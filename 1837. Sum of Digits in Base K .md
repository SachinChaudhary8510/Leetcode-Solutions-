# 🔢 LeetCode Problem - 1837. Sum of Digits in Base K

## 🚀 Problem Statement

> Given an integer `n` (in base 10) and a base `k`, return the sum of the digits of `n` after converting `n` from base 10 to base `k`.
>
> Each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number, and the final sum should also be returned in base 10.

## 🧩 Examples

### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9

Explanation:
- 34 in base 6 is "54"
- 5 + 4 = 9
```

### ✅ Example 2:
```
Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1

Explanation:
- 10 in base 10 is "10"
- 1 + 0 = 1
```

---

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 10`

---

## 💡 Intuition

This is a base conversion problem with a twist:

1. Convert `n` to base `k`.
2. Sum the digits of the base-`k` number.
3. Return the result in base 10.

We can compute the digits without creating a string representation by using division and modulus.

## 🧑‍💻 Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int r = n % k;
            sum += r;
            n /= k;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

## 🐍 Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def sumBase(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        while n > 0:
            total += n % k
            n //= k
        return total
```

## 💻 C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
