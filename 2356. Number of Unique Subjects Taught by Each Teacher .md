# 🟢 LeetCode 2356: Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a table `Teacher` that stores the subjects each teacher teaches in different departments, write a query to return the number of **unique subjects** each teacher teaches.

### 🔹 Table: `Teacher`
| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |

**Primary Key:** (`subject_id`, `dept_id`)  
Each row indicates that the teacher with `teacher_id` teaches the `subject_id` in the `dept_id`.

## 🧩 Example

### Input:
**Teacher Table**
```
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |
+------------+------------+---------+
```

### Output:
```
+------------+-----+
| teacher_id | cnt |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |
+------------+-----+
```

### Explanation:
- Teacher 1 teaches subject 2 in two departments (counts as 1 unique subject) and subject 3 (1 subject) → **2 unique subjects**
- Teacher 2 teaches four different subjects in one department → **4 unique subjects**

## ✅ MySQL Solution

```sql
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

**📝 Explanation:**  
- `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)` ensures that multiple departments for the same subject are not double-counted.
- `GROUP BY teacher_id` aggregates per teacher.

---

## ✅ PostgreSQL Solution

```sql
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

_PostgreSQL handles `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` the same way as MySQL._

---

## ✅ Pandas (Python) Solution

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_unique_subjects(teacher: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return (
        teacher.drop_duplicates(subset=['teacher_id', 'subject_id'])
               .groupby('teacher_id')
               .size()
               .reset_index(name='cnt')
    )
```

**📝 Explanation:**  
- Drop duplicate combinations of teacher and subject.
- Group by `teacher_id` and count occurrences.

## 🏆 Summary

| Language     | Query/Logic                                | Notes                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| MySQL/SQL    | `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)` + GROUP BY     | Efficient, concise            |
| PostgreSQL   | Same as MySQL                               | Supported natively            |
| Python/Pandas| Drop duplicates + groupby + size            | Useful for data pipelines     |

🧠 **Key Insight:** Use `DISTINCT` to eliminate subject duplication across departments.
