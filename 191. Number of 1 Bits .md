# 🟢 LeetCode 191: Number of 1 Bits

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the **Hamming weight**).

### 🔹 Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 11`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which contains **three** set bits.

### 🔹 Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 128`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of `128` is `10000000`, which contains **one** set bit.

### 🔹 Example 3:
**Input:**  
`n = 2147483645`  
**Output:**  
`30`  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of `2147483645` is `1111111111111111111111111111101`, which contains **thirty** set bits.

## 🚀 Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`  

### 🔥 Optimization Challenge:
If this function is called multiple times, how can we optimize it?

## ✅ Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0, r = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            r = n % 2;
            if (r == 1)
                count++;
            n /= 2;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- Uses modulo (`% 2`) to check if the least significant bit is `1`.  
- If `1`, increments `count`.  
- Uses integer division (`n /= 2`) to shift bits to the right.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## 🔷 Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return count
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- Uses bitwise `& 1` to check if the least significant bit is `1`.  
- Right shifts (`>>= 1`) to move to the next bit.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## 🔶 C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n) {
            count += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- Similar approach using bitwise `&` and right shift.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## 🔥 Optimized Approach (Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm)
Instead of checking each bit individually, we can use:
```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        n = n & (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```
**Why is this faster?**  
Each operation removes the rightmost `1` bit, reducing the number of iterations.

⏳ **Time Complexity:** `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of set bits (much faster for sparse bit patterns).  
💾 **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

## 🏆 Summary
| Language | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Approach |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Java     | O(log n)      | O(1)           | Modulo & Division |
| Python   | O(log n)      | O(1)           | Bitwise & and Shift |
| C++      | O(log n)      | O(1)           | Bitwise & and Shift |
| Optimized | O(k)         | O(1)           | Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm |

🎯 **Best for multiple calls:** Use **Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm**.  
🛠 **Readable & simple:** Use **Basic Iteration** (Java, Python, C++).
