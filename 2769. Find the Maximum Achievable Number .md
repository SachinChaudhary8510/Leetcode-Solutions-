# 🧠 LeetCode Problem - 2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number

## 🚀 Problem Statement

> Given two integers, `num` and `t`. A number `x` is **achievable** if it can become equal to `num` after applying the following operation at most `t` times:
>
> **Increase or decrease** `x` by 1, and **simultaneously increase or decrease** `num` by 1.
>
> Your task is to return the **maximum possible value** of `x`.

## 🧩 Examples

### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input:  num = 4, t = 1  
Output: 6  
Explanation:  
→ Decrease `x` by 1 and increase `num` by 1:  
→ `x = x - 1`, `num = num + 1` → `x` becomes 6 when `num` becomes 5 → match achievable.
```

### ✅ Example 2:
```
Input:  num = 3, t = 2  
Output: 7  
Explanation:  
→ Perform the operation twice:  
→ `x = x - 2`, `num = num + 2` → `x = 7`, `num = 1` → reverse operations for match.
```

---

## 📌 Constraints
- `1 <= num, t <= 50`

---

## 💡 Intuition

Each operation shifts both `num` and `x` in **opposite directions**.  
So, in `t` operations, the distance between them can increase by `2 * t`.  
Thus, the **maximum achievable** value of `x` is simply:

```
x = num + 2 * t
```

## 🧑‍💻 Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num + (2 * t);
    }
}
```

---

## 🐍 Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:
        return num + (2 * t)
```

---

## 💻 C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num + (2 * t);
    }
};
```

## 🏁 Summary
This is a classic case of **symmetrical operations** leading to predictable mathematical results.  
Simple, clean, and linear — ideal for quick optimization and cross-language comparison. ✅
